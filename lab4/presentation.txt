I need to cover top, gprof (which includes gcov) and callgrind (which includes cachegrind).

First, show Ion's slides. Cover matrix format.

Then, run matrix_htop, and show memory usage with top. Press o while in top, and enter COMMAND=matrix_htop and press enter.

Then, compare matrix and matrix_function with time.


Obviously, matrix_function.c is slower, since it has the overhead of a function call.

Then, run gprof on both of them, see that there is a large difference (in terms of % time taken) between fill_one and fill_two in matrix, but hardly any difference between them in matrix_function (because most of the time is taken by function overhead). 

Forget about matrix_function for now.

So, why does fill_one run much faster than fill_two?

Start with matrix_callgrind. This only fills a 1000x1000 matrix (so I don't have to stand at the board for 2 minutes akwardly).

valgrind --tool=callgrind --cache-sim=yes ./matrix_callgrind
callgrind_annotate --auto=yes cachegrind.out.<pid>

Explain what the D1mw and DLmw are, and point out the differences between them from fill_one and fill_two.

Then, show the access pattern on a 5x5 matrix with matrix_demo.


Finally, show that compiling matrix.c and matrix_function.c with -O3 equalizes the time taken (probably because it removed the function call overhead).
